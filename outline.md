## Textbook

None!

But we would recommend "Dive into Deep Learning" ([d2l.ai](https://d2l.ai/)) for a comprehensive and practical introduction to the field.

# Philosophy

## Thorough and detailed
- Understand the foundations and the landscape of deep learning.
- Be able to write from scratch, debug and run (some) deep learning algorithms.

## State-of-the-art
- Introduction to materials new from research ($\leq$ 5 years old).
- Understand some of the open questions and challenges in the field.

## Practical
- Fun and challenging course project.
