## Project

See instructions in [`project.md`](https://github.com/glouppe/info8010-deep-learning/blob/master/project.md).

## Reading assignment

Your task is to read and summarize a major scientific paper in the field of deep learning. You are free to select one among the following three papers:

> - J. Redmon and A. Farhadi, "YOLO9000: Better, Faster, Stronger", 2017. [[pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242)]
> - A. Vaswani et al, "Attention is all you need", 2017. [[pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)]
> - M. Geiger et al, "Scaling description of generalization with number of parameters in deep learning", 2019. [[pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01608)]

You should produce a report that summarizes the problem that is tackled by the paper and explains why it is challenging or important. The report should outline the main contributions and results with respect to the problem that is addressed. It should also include a critical discussion of the advantages and shortcomings of the contributions of the paper.

Constraints:
- You can work in groups of maximum 3 students.
- You report must be written in English.
- 2 pages (excluding references, if any).
- Formatted using the LaTeX template [`template-report.tex`](https://glouppe.github.io/info8010-deep-learning/template-report.tex).

Your report should be submitted  by **April 3, 2020 at 23:59** on the [submission platform](https://submit.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/). This is a **hard** deadline.
